# Random Number Generator (RNG)

The Random Number Generator (RNG) algorithm for the original-games engine is designed to generate a deterministic stream of bytes based on these given input parameters: 
- server seed
- client seed
- nonce
- cursor

This algorithm leverages **HMAC-SHA256 hashing to produce a pseudo-random sequence of bytes**. These bytes are then cast to floating point values creating an RNG from a uniformly distributed set of floats. This is the basis of the number generator of any game built on top of this engine.

This algorithm is developed in Go and it utilizes `crypto/hmac` & `crypto/sha256` from Go's standard library as the foundation of the randomly generated bytes. This algorithm is **exclusively invoked** every time a random event occurs in any game built with this engine.

# Implementation Details

## Byte Generator

The core of the RNG mechanism is the `ByteGenerator` function. This function creates a stream of pseudo-random bytes utilising a go channel, based on the provided server seed, client seed, nonce, cursor, and the number of bytes to generate (`count`). this is where the HMAC-SHA256, a cryptographic hash function is invoked to deterministically derive 32-byte digests **by hashing the combined input of client seed, nonce, and a round number using the server seed as the HMAC key.**

The generator keeps track of the `currentRound` and `currentRoundCursor` to determine where in the HMAC digest to start reading bytes. If all 32 bytes of a digest are consumed, it increments the round and generates a new HMAC digest. This continues until the total number of requested bytes (`count`) has been produced. The resulting byte stream is sent asynchronously over a buffered channel, allowing the consumer (such as`GenerateFloats()`) to pull one byte at a time as needed.


```go
func ByteGenerator(serverSeed string, clientSeed string, nonce, cursor, count int) chan byte {
	ch := make(chan byte, 64)
	go func() {
		defer close(ch)
		// once all the HMAC digest is used (all 32 bytes), a new currentRound is needed
		currentRound := cursor / 32
		// The position to start reading the HMAC digest from
		currentRoundCursor := cursor % 32
		bytesGenerated := 0
		for bytesGenerated < count {
			var b []byte = []byte(serverSeed)
			hmac := hmac.New(sha256.New, b)
			hmac.Write(fmt.Appendf(nil, "%s:%s:%d", clientSeed, strconv.Itoa(nonce), currentRound))
			buffer := hmac.Sum(nil)
			for currentRoundCursor < 32 {
				ch <- buffer[currentRoundCursor]
				currentRoundCursor++
				bytesGenerated++
			}
			currentRoundCursor = 0
			currentRound++
		}
	}()
	return ch
}
```

## Converting to Floats

As an interface to the ByteGenerator, the function `GenerateFloats` is developed which consumes the byte stream and converts it into random `float64` values.

- Once the required bytes are collected, the function processes them in chunks of 4 bytes
- Converts each chunk to a 32-bit unsigned integer using big-endian byte order
- Normalizes the value by dividing it by `2^32` to get a float between 0 and 1.


Other interface functions could be developed in the future such as a "random range" where the output float range would be parameters to the function. The RNG was purposfully designed, as can be seen in the code, to handle many interface functions without touching the fundamenal `ByteGenerator` which will be used for each interface function.


```go
func (r RandomGenerator) GenerateFloats(serverSeed, clientSeed string, nonce, cursor, count int) ([]float64, error) {
	if count < 0 {
		return []float64{}, errors.New("count parameter should be greater than 0")
	}
	rng := byteGenerator(serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce, cursor, count*4)
	byteSet := make([]byte, 0, count*4)
	for len(byteSet) < (count * 4) {
		b := <-rng
		byteSet = append(byteSet, b)
	}
	floats := make([]float64, count)
	for i := range floats {
		chunk := byteSet[i*4 : (i+1)*4]
		var value uint32
		err := binary.Read(bytes.NewBuffer(chunk), binary.BigEndian, &value)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		floats[i] = float64(value) / (1 << 32)
	}
	return floats, nil
}
```

## RNG Utilisation

In the original-games project, We defined an interface with "wrapper" methods to generate a list of float64 values given seeds, a nonce, and a cursor.

```go
type RNG interface {
	GenerateFloats(serverSeed, clientSeed string, nonce, cursor, count int) ([]float64, error)
}
```

So in order to use the random number generator the interface is instantiated and any method from that interface can be called like so:

```go
rng := utils.RandomGenerator{}
values, err := rng.GenerateFloats("server-secret", "user-seed", 42, 0, 5)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println(values) // Example output: [0.23423 0.9821 0.4372 0.0013 0.8751]
```

To show that the output is a uniformly distributed set of floats between 0 and 1. Running the above command in a loop incrementing the nonce each time for 100k random floats produced the below distribution:
